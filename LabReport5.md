Title: Bugging in StringServer

Catagory: Lab Reports

Hi, I'm working on my lab report 2 on Edstem. I don't know what happed in my StringServer.java. Everytime when I 'm using ```/add-message?s=<string>```, and then ```/increment```, the next call of ```/add-message?s=<string>``` becomes ```n+2.<string>``` instead of ```n+1.<string>```.

I guess there are some bugs in ```else if (url.getPath().contains("/add-message")) {```. I think this statement is reached even though I called ```/increment```, which means ```/increment``` and ```/add-message?s=<string>``` are called at the same time. . 

2. A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try (To be clear, you are mimicking a TA here.)

Hi Qianyi, thanks for the question and the screenshot.I believe the issue comes from your counter of the method. In your code, the ```/increment``` and ```/add-message?s=<string>``` share the same counter ```num```. Thus, to solve the bug, you need to separate them. One way is to 
create another counter for ```/add-message```. 

3.Another screenshot/terminal output showing what information the student got from trying that, and a clear description of what the bug is.

Ohh! I see! Thank you! The bug is I have a duplicated counter for two if statement. Now it is fixed. I added a counter for ```add-message```, which is msgcount. And in the if statement of add-message, I changed num to msgcount. Thus, there are two counter for two if statement.
