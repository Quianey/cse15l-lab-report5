Title: Bugging in StringServer

Catagory: Lab Reports

Hi, I'm working on my lab report 2 on Edstem. I don't know what happed in my StringServer.java. Everytime when I 'm using ```/add-message?s=<string>```, it always returns ```404 no found```.

I guess there are some bugs in the location of return statement. I think my code actually doesn't go into the if statement of finding path ```/add-message``` and directly return ```404 no found```. 

2. A response from a TA asking a leading question or suggesting a command to try (To be clear, you are mimicking a TA here.)

Hi Qianyi, thanks for the question and the screenshot.I believe the issue comes from your if statement instead of return part. Please make sure that your if statement includes exactly ```/add-message```. In your if statement, you should split the query by ```=```. And your ```parameter[0]```
should be ```s```.
